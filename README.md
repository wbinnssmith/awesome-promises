> A curated list of useful resources for JavaScript Promises

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing. Not to be confused with other awesome promises like "I promise you a million dollars" or "I promise you'll stay fit and never have to go to the gym again".

## Promises/A+ Implementations (ES6/ES2015 compatible)

### Strict Implementations
These implement no more or less than the es6 spec. They make great polyfills and are exceptionally compatible with native promises.

* [pinkie](https://github.com/floatdrop/pinkie) - Ponyfill. Node-oriented, but [browserifyable](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify). *Extremely* small implementation.
* [native-promise-only](https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only) - Polyfill. Browser and node-compatible.
* [es6-promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise) - Opt-in polyfill. A strict-spec subset of rsvp.js.
* [lie](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie) - Small, browserifyable with an opt-in polyfill.

### Implementations with extras
All of these provide more features than the language yet remain compatible. Node + Browsers for all.

* [bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) - Fully featured, extremely performant. Long stack traces & generator/coroutine support.
* [creed](https://github.com/briancavalier/creed) - Hyper performant & full featured like Bluebird, but FP-oriented. Coroutines, generators, promises, ES2015 iterables, & fantasy-land spec.
* [rsvp.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js/) - Lightweight with a few extras. Compatible down to IE6!
* [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) - One of the original implementations. Long stack traces and other goodies.
* [then/promise](https://github.com/then/promise) - Small with `nodeify`, `denodify` and `done()` additions.
* [when.js](https://github.com/cujojs/when) - Packed with control flow, functional, and utility methods.


### Fallbacks
* [native-or-bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/native-or-bluebird) - Helps transition to completely native.
* [pinkie-promise](https://github.com/floatdrop/pinkie-promise) - Use native, or fall back to `pinkie`. Great for node library authors.
* [any-promise](https://github.com/kevinbeaty/any-promise) - Loads the first available implementation. Safe for browserify.

## Convenience Utilities
Native and strictly spec-compliant promises are awesome for compatibility, future-proofness, library authors, and browsers. However, libraries like bluebird patch goodies onto the `Promise` constructor and prototype. Solution? tiny modules of course!
