# Awesome Promises [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> A curated list of useful resources for JavaScript Promises

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing. Not to be confused with other awesome promises like "I promise you a million dollars" or "I promise you'll stay fit and never have to go to the gym again".

## Promises/A+ Implementations (ES6/ES2015 compatible)

### Strict Implementations
These implement no more or less than the es6 spec. They make great polyfills and are exceptionally compatible with native promises.

* [pinkie ★96](https://github.com/floatdrop/pinkie) - Ponyfill. Node-oriented, but [browserifyable](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify). *Extremely* small implementation.
* [native-promise-only ★453](https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only) - Polyfill. Browser and node-compatible.
* [**es6-promise ★2,971**](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise) - Opt-in polyfill. A strict-spec subset of rsvp.js.
* [lie ★427](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie) - Small, browserifyable with an opt-in polyfill.

### Implementations with extras
All of these provide more features than the language yet remain compatible. Node + Browsers for all.

* [**bluebird ★10,725**](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) - Fully featured, extremely performant. Long stack traces & generator/coroutine support.
* [rsvp.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js/) - Lightweight with a few extras. Compatible down to IE6!
* [**Q ★11,488**](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) - One of the original implementations. Long stack traces and other goodies.
* [**then/promise ★1,112**](https://github.com/then/promise) - Small with `nodeify`, `denodify` and `done()` additions.
* [**when.js ★2,921**](https://github.com/cujojs/when) - Packed with control flow, functional, and utility methods.


### Fallbacks
* [native-or-bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/native-or-bluebird) - Helps transition to completely native.
* [pinkie-promise ★68](https://github.com/floatdrop/pinkie-promise) - Use native, or fall back to `pinkie`. Great for node library authors.
* [any-promise ★47](https://github.com/kevinbeaty/any-promise) - Loads the first available implementation. Safe for browserify.

## Convenience Utilities
Native and strictly spec-compliant promises are awesome for compatibility, future-proofness, library authors, and browsers. However, libraries like bluebird patch goodies onto the `Promise` constructor and prototype. Solution? tiny modules of course!

* [pify ★159](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pify) - Promisify ("denodify") a callback-style function.
* [promise-each ★10](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/promise-each) - Standalone `bluebird.each`. Execute one after the other sequentially.
* [promise-filter ★6](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/promise-filter) - Standalone `bluebird.filter`. Filter an array to a promise.
* [promise-finally ★2](https://github.com/blakeembrey/promise-finally) - Standalone bluebird `finally()`. Execute a handler unconditionally after others have been handled.
* [promise-map ★7](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/promise-map) - Standalone `bluebird.map`. Map an array to a promise.
* [promise-method ★1](https://github.com/wbinnssmith/promise-method) - Standalone `bluebird.method`. Turn a synchronously-returning method into a promise-returning one.
* [promise-props ★3](https://github.com/exponentjs/promise-props) - Standalone implementation of bluebird's `bluebird.props` or rsvp's `RSVP.hash`
* [promise-reduce ★6](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/promise-reduce) - Standalone `bluebird.reduce`. Reduce an array to a promise.
* [promise-some ★4](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/promise-some) - Standalone `bluebird.some`. Check if an element passes the predicate, return a promise.
* [promise-try ★2](https://github.com/wbinnssmith/promise-try) - Standalone `bluebird.try`. Execute a synchronously-returning function and return a promise.
* [is-promise ★22](https://github.com/then/is-promise) - Determine if something looks like a Promise.
* [sprom ★10](https://github.com/then/sprom) - Resolve when a stream ends. Optional buffering (be careful with this!)
* [**task.js ★1,490**](https://github.com/mozilla/task.js) - Write async functions in a blocking style using promises and generators. Like `bluebird.coroutine`.
* [**co ★5,192**](https://github.com/tj/co) - Like `task.js` and `bluebird.coroutine`, but supports thunks too.
* [lie-fs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lie-fs) - Promise wrappers for Node's FS API.
* [immediate-promise ★37](https://github.com/sindresorhus/immediate-promise) - Returns a promise resolved in the next event loop - think `setImmediate()`.
* [delay ★82](https://github.com/sindresorhus/delay) - Delay a promise a specified amount of time.
* [promise-whilst ★15](https://github.com/sindresorhus/promise-whilst) - Calls a function repeatedly if and while a condition returns true and then resolves the promise.
* [loud-rejection ★87](https://github.com/sindresorhus/loud-rejection) - Make unhandled promise rejections fail loudly instead of the default silent fail.
* [promise-until ★0](https://github.com/busterc/promise-until) - Calls a function repeatedly if a condition returns false and until the condition returns true and then resolves the promise.
* [promise-do-until ★0](https://github.com/busterc/promise-do-until) - Calls a function repeatedly until a condition returns true and then resolves the promise.
* [promise-do-whilst ★0](https://github.com/busterc/promise-do-whilst) - Calls a function repeatedly while a condition returns true and then resolves the promise.
* [promise-semaphore ★22](https://github.com/samccone/promise-semaphore) - Push a set of work to be done in a configurable serial fashion
